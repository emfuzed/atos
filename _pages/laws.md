In the Federal government, the principal law governing the security of information systems is the **Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)**. For more information on FISMA, check out the [FISMA Ready introduction](https://github.com/fisma-ready/introduction).

One of the goals of the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) is to “provide a comprehensive framework for ensuring the effectiveness of information security controls over information resources that support Federal operations and assets.” The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) was tasked with designing and implementing this framework: the result is NIST’s Risk Management Framework (RMF). All federal information and information systems (except classified information and national security systems) are subject to NIST’s RMF. There's [an introduction to the RMF on NIST's website](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/fisma/framework.html). A more comprehensive guide, including how to apply the framework, references to the various relevant publications, and definitions of roles and responsibilities, is found in NIST's [Special Publication 800-37](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-37r1.pdf).
